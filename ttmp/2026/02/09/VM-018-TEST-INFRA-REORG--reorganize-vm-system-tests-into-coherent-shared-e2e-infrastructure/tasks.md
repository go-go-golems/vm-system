# Tasks

## TODO

- [x] Create VM-018 ticket scaffold, analysis guide, diary skeleton, and executable task plan
- [x] Extract a shared shell harness for daemon-first tests and migrate smoke/e2e scripts to use it (including stale module assertion fix)
- [ ] Consolidate overlapping library-focused scripts into a single capability matrix test with clear pass/fail expectations
- [ ] Add a coherent top-level test runner + update README/getting-started docs to reflect the new test architecture
- [ ] Run validation (go test + script suite), update diary/changelog with evidence, and close VM-018
